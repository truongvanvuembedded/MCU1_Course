# Mastering Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development

Description of Project: Write low-level hardware drivers using Embedded C: Developing drivers for STM32 GPIO, I2C, SPI, USART, and other peripherals from scratch.

- **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)**
- **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**
- **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)**
- **Peripheral IRQs/Vector table/NVIC interfaces**
- **Different MCU clocks like HCLK, PCLK, PLL,..**
- **Quick ways of debugging peripheral**
- **MCU bus interfaces, clock sources, MCU clock configurations**
